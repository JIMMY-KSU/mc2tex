# MC2TeX

This free Mathcad to LaTeX converter is designed to export large calculations from Mathcad and convert the formulars to LaTeX-Code so you don't have to copy everything by hand.

Text formatting will not be converted by now. Also, if the text areas contain formating, they may not be converted correctly.
